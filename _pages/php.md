# PHP

PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used server-side scripting language designed for web development. It is embedded in HTML and is particularly suited for creating dynamic web pages, handling forms, and interacting with databases. PHP powers many popular content management systems (CMS) like WordPress and frameworks like Laravel.
