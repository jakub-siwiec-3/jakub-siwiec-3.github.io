# Visual Basic

Visual Basic (VB) is an event-driven programming language and environment from Microsoft that provides a graphical user interface which allows programmers to modify code by simply dragging and dropping objects and defining their behavior and appearance. VB is derived from the BASIC programming language and is considered to be event-driven and object-oriented.
